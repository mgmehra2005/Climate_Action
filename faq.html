                <p>Emissions by reducing energy consumption. Using recycled materials to make new products reduces the need for virgin materials. ... Waste prevention and smart shopping are even more effective at reducing green house gas emissions that result from energy consumption.</p>

                <summary><b>What are the three most evident causes of climate change?</b></summary><br>
                <p>The main causes of climate change are: Humanity's increased use of fossil fuels - such as coal, oil and gas to generate electricity, run cars and other forms of transport, and power manufacturing and industry. Deforestation - because living trees absorb and store carbon dioxide.</p>

                <summary><b>What is the difference between climate change and global warming?</b></summary><br>
                <p>“Global warming” refers to the rise in global temperatures due mainly to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “Climate change” refers to the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time - including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns</p>

                <summary><b>How does climate change affect atmosphere?</b></summary><br>
                <p>The atmosphere is warming. We're starting to feel the effects. A warming atmosphere affects more than just air temperatures: while heat waves and droughts are becoming more common and intense, rainstorms are also becoming more powerful, sometimes provoking dangerous floods.</p>

                <summary><b>How can trees help climate change?</b></summary><br>
                <p>As trees grow, they help stop climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air, storing carbon in the trees and soil, and releasing oxygen into the atmosphere.</p>
